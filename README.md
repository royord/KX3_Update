KX3 Lite
======================================
In interest of documenting the needs for a QRP radio that a backpacker can carry, I'm opening this project so that I can track the changes and ideas that I have over time, really only time will tell if someone can build the ultimate backpacker QRP radio.

Backpackers are a completely different type of QRP user, while QRP for the day user makes the KX3 quite possibly the best radio ever, a backpacker takes it to a completely different level. Weight matters, every ounce that can be squeezed out of a device is likely the device that is going to be the one that is going to win.

KX3 Updates
-----------
- While it would be nice to have all frequencies it may not be absolutely necessary. The core frequencies for long distance low power contacts would be the best to have. Include all if it doesn't add hardware, idealy 10 - 80 meters would be the best, so that even when the bands are bad the radio may be able to get out on 80 meters.
- Remove some of the buttons, or allow buttons to be assigned in the menu, or by the application that allows configuration while at home.
- Make some of the buttons light up with LED in the back ground. LED would be the best for weight and the amount of power used to light up the buttons.
- Remove the metal bezzel and put the entire radio in a waterproof or water resistant case, with room for a small key and small hand mic, you can even make those if you like. I've been looking at a capacative touch keyer to save space and mounting the keyer into the case like has been done on radio-set-go.com. Have an addon that's a stem type mic that plugs in or a bluetooth mic that you can be away from the radio and still have hand mic type ability.
- Waterproof antenna port so that antenna can be connected with radio box closed and hand mic will still key radio and chat in rain PRC-77 type or some variation that is more common. http://www.phoenixofchicago.com/products/EnvironmentalConnectors.cfm
- Remove built in speaker, make it a module that can be mounted in the top of the waterproof case, the currently included speaker doesn't replace good headphones anyway and I would carry headphones for decent operation.
- Default to back light for the unit to off and have ONE small button that says "light" that is always lit up that says "light" or has the light bulb signal, this will be used to turn on the back light during dark times
- Include RTC by default, backpackers don't often know what time it is, having that built into the radio wouldn't be a huge cost and would be a major benefit.
- Maybe include something so that the unit can do APRS on 30 meter by default, this would also include a GPS unit, which could be used to set the RTC, if it is onboard. Since we would have bluetooth put in an app for phones that would be along
- Drop modes that aren't used, AM, on the main unit or able to turn it off when QRP so you don't end up there on accident.
- Put something in the programming that makes the unit stay within the allocated amature bands if the menu item is activated, so that you can scan without worrying about falling out of bands while in the dark. This could be programmed at home with a computer so that it doesn't have to happen on the unit itself.
- Ability to program macro's to custom buttons or menu items that can store a set of settings. So that say I want to be in 30 Meter APRS I can have my own custom settings for APRS, then if I want to go to SSB on 20 meter I go to my pre-programmed 20 meter button or menu item and my preset filters are ready to go with compression settings.
- External Power that can be connected, drop the internal power completely, it's not needed.
- Power connector and module that allows you to use a solar panel to trickel charge a set of batteries while using the solar power for operating during the day, goal zero has some good panels, I have also found some good panels that are rollable. http://www.infinitypv.com/infinitypro/opv/foil
- Keep the large screen, this is key for people like myself who have relatively little eyesight if corrective lenses aren't worn.
- USB connector to upgrade radio.
- Ability to do PSK Mail from a modile iOS or Android device would be amazing!
- Since we have Bluetooth it would be cool if you could do Digital work directly with fldigi through the bluetooth with the your computer connected without all the cables, or do it with your iOS/android device.

There are a lot of questions with this radio still left unresolved however I would get one of these radios
even with the current shortcomings due to the fact of size and portability over any other radio.
